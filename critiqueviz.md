# Step 1: Find A Visualization + Its Associated Data

## Ranked: The 50 Most Visited Websites in the World

I decided to recreate this visualization instead of a more policy based one. Social media and tech are huge components of our lives. I was curious abot Facebook's earnings call which took place a few days ago and I wanted to see how visits to all these sites hhad sort of changed in the past one year. The concept of billions of people using your site and still having a huge drop in stock price was somewhat facinitating to me. Hence, I decided to see if I can visualize how big these comoanies are in comparies to those on the lower end of the spectrum visits.

## Original Visualizations
The names of the visualizations that I am critiquing from this website mentioned above is: “The Top 50 Most Visited Websites in the World”.

This is the original visualization created by visual capital:
