# Step 1: Find A Visualization + Its Associated Data

## Ranked: The 50 Most Visited Websites in the World

I decided to recreate this visualization instead of a more policy based one. Social media and tech are huge components of our lives. I was curious abot Facebook's earnings call which took place a few days ago and I wanted to see how visits to all these sites hhad sort of changed in the past one year. The concept of billions of people using your site and still having a huge drop in stock price was somewhat facinitating to me. Hence, I decided to see if I can visualize how big these comoanies are in comparies to those on the lower end of the spectrum visits.

## Original Visualizations
The names of the visualizations that I am critiquing from this website mentioned above is: “The Top 50 Most Visited Websites in the World”.

This is the original visualization created by visual capital:

## Data Source

The data used in the above visualization can be found [Visual Capital](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-50-most-visited-websites-in-the-world/). Following from that, the data used for mu visualization was also obtained from the same website. The steps are:
1). Copied the link of the wbsite
2). Opened up excel
3). Proceed to the data tab
4). On the left hand side, there is a get data button with a web drawn on it
5). Pasted my link into the window. Next, the data was loaded into a csv format.
6). Lastly, I loaded it and saved it locally into my computer.

# Step 2: Critique the Visualization

### Usefulness:

I think the visualization is very effective at communicating to the audience that we are dealing with influence( or size) of some kind. However, I think it fails in tellin the audience what manner of influence exactly. Even though it fails to do this, it is still understable. However, the major flaw is that it visualizes numbers to show this influence and this can be interpreted in too many ways.

### Completeness:

Despite my criricism above, I think the visualizations are fairly complete. It does a good job of providing an almost complete argument to the audience.

### Perceptibility:

In terms of perceptibility, this passes the test. The human eye can see the visualization and have a very good idea of what exactly is being conveyed. In addition, using a bubble graph to show size and compare it to other big companies helps drive the message home succintly.

### Truthfulness:

It does appear that the visualization is accurated and reliable. A quick comparison with the raw data shows that the biggest bubbke on the graph matches up with that on the excel sheet. Likewise, same can be said of the smallest bubble.

### Intuitiveness:

I think a comfortable majority can come up with a quick summary of the graph. It may not be accurae However, readers can come to the conclusion that "Google, Youtube, Facebook" big. This makes the overall trend very clear.


### Aesthetics:

I am not a big fan of the overall aesthetics. I would have preferred more compact coloring in the grouoing of the app. The same colors should have been used for the category f apps that fell into the same group. Secondly, there were some little details such as "the most followed accounts" which felt unncecessary to me. 

### Enagement:

The visualization definitely leads the audience to learn more about the topic. It encourages them to ask about trends and growth rate of these comoanies to see how they have changed from small upstarts to major corporations.

## Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?

I feel the data visualization was informative but not necessarily emotive. It was useful and complete in terms of being able to convey information. Any person viewing the visualization is very clear about what the visualizer is trying to convey. However, it lacks a bit in intuitiveness. The audience can make the mistake of intuitively thinking that the "financial value" of the biggest companies is what is being conveyed. Finally, it is very engaging. The labeling of some parts of the data is bound to draw in an audience

## Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?

The primary audience are most likely students or policymakers interested in knowing what websites are visited the most. If there is a previous discussion of the topic and the visualization is presented, both groups of people will be able to understand the data presented in the visualization. Hence, effective.

## Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) *

It was somewhat successful n evaluating the data. My first recommendation is to advocate for the removal of the values. It runs the risk of making people think we are talking about worth instead of worldwide visits. Secondly, the legend in the left hand side of the visualize should have been assigned colors based on the category of the ap. This will have been consistent with the color grading provided in other parts of the visualization.

# Step 3: Wireframe a Solution
For this solution, I removed the value and simply persisted with just the size. This helps my audience stick with the fact that I am talking generally about influence and not something else. In addition, I grouped the various app categories by colors. I also added the ability to be able to filter by country so we can have anidea of the biggest website visits by country.

# Step 4: Test your Solution
I tested my sketch with two individuals. The first individual said list of tech companies and their relative size. The second individual said tech apps we used the most. As expected, it was a bit of a stretch to expect them to know it was a ranking of websites. However, both participants were able to guess it was a graph about size and influence.
