#  Change Based on user Review

My feedback from user review made me realize that my topic was not well streamlined for a good narrative structure. In addition, there was not enough data to tell the kind of story I wanted tot tell. My old outline can be found [here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/finalprojectone) while my outline for my new topic can be found [here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/finalprojectrejig)
