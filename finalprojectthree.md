# Part 3: Final Project
## Shorthand

My final website, made on shorthand, can be found [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-opioid-crisis/index.html).

For Part 2 of my final project, I wireframed my data story, created a few visuals, and conducted user research to get feedback on the wireframe and charts. The final piece of this project involved bringing it all together and making appropriate adjustments.

## User Feedback
I made some key changes from part 2 of my final project. This was based on feedback received from my audience. The feedback
- Changed my very first graph which I used for comparison. My audeinece felt the original diagram was just two circles and was not doing a good job of conveying my intention.
- It read more like a data report and less like a story of the opioid crisis. To correct this, i added sections which showed the opioid usage rate from the 1980s till now, and how discussed the many reasons for the growth of the crisis.
- Refined my action points and gave congent steps to take to help
- For my graph which brke down the opioid usage by age, I changed the colour and decided to use the one colour(but with different grades). This ensured the particular demographic I wanted to emphasize was able to stand out. This differed from the rainbow like colour scheme I used originally.

## Audience
Due to the adjustments made, I was able to make sure my final version was able to appeal to not only healthcare policy students, it can also appeal to everyday people. Or people who are simply interested in giving a quick read of the topic.

For the major visualizations in the final version, I made sure I only used either a line chart or a bar chart. This provides the advantage of making sure my audience is able to view just the images and get a good view of my topic without even reading the long paragraphs in the topic. 

## Designing the End Product
The final step involved putting everything together in Shorthand. To create a ore aesthetic feel, I added background images that correlated with opioid usage. This project made me understand the importance of good feedback and constant iteration. I was also able to transform the idea of the final version of the website in my head into a cogent visual version. Secondly, I also received a lot of feedback about the areas people would be intersted in concerning the topic. They include:
- The effect of opioid usage among different racial demographics
- The tratment of opioid addicts and how historically marginalized communities are not beneficiaries of this treatment
- Why the methods for the "war on opioids" should not mirror the techniques used for the War on Drugs
