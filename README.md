# About me
Hi! My name is Toorese from Lagos, Nigeria. I am a second year masters student in the PPM-DA program. I love data and he many insights that can be gleaned from it. I came to Heinz to learn how best data can be used, both rightly and wrongly to inform policy. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn the best way data can be used to convey and express intentions in the most convincing way. After Heinz, fingers crossed, I hope to pick up expereince in organizations that help to analyze data and do meaningful work.
