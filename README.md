# Toorese-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU

# About me
Hi! My name is Toorese from Lagos, Nigeria. I am a second year masters student at CMU in the PPM-DA program. My undergraduate degree is in economics. After undergrad, I worked as a credit collection analyst for a fintech start-up. After that,  worked as a polcy analyst for the federal government. I love data and he many insights that can be gleaned from it. I came to Heinz to learn how best data can be used, both rightly and wrongly, to inform policy.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn the best way data can be used to convey and express intentions in the most convincing way. After Heinz, fingers crossed, I hope to pick up expereince in organizations that help to analyze data and do meaningful work.

This is my portfolio for future viewing
## Assignment 1
This is a visualization showing debt to GDP ratio of various governments all over the world, and my subsequent critique. Click [here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/govtdataviz)

## Assignment 2
I used Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) to critique a visualizzation from Visual Capital. Consequently, I wireframed a poential solution o the issues I found, tested the solution and drew up my own version of the visualization.

## Final Project 1
Here, I talked about the data I want to use for my final project, storyboarding and my initial sketches. Click [here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/finalprojectone)

## Final Project 1
My final project part 1 is lacking the necessary data to build a narative structure. hence, I decided to do a change of topic. My storyboarding and initial sketches for the new topic can be found here.

## Final Project Part 2
Here, I talk about my final project storyboard and user research
